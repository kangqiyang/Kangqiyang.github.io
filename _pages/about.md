Hello! I am a first-year M.S. student in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). Before joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) in 2025, where I conducted research in theoratical and computational chemistry advised by [Dr. Wen Shi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wen-Shi-11?ev=brs_overview).

My research interests currently center on large language model (LLM) agents, with an emphasis on developing and post-training agents capable of reasoning over complex scientific systems (AI for Science).

Feel free to reach out via email at `kangqi.yang [at] gatech.edu` if you are interested in discussing research ideas.
